## Data Flow

### Authentication Flow
1. User initiates login through Replit Auth
2. OpenID Connect handles authentication with secure tokens
3. Session created in PostgreSQL with encrypted user data
4. Client receives authentication status via API endpoints

### Payment Processing Flow
1. User initiates payment through QR scan or manual entry
2. System validates user balance and merchant information
3. Transaction record created with pending status
4. Payment processing (online/offline) based on connectivity
5. Transaction status updated and balance adjusted
6. Real-time UI updates via TanStack Query

### Data Synchronization
1. Offline transactions stored locally with timestamp
2. Background sync attempts when connectivity detected
3. Conflict resolution for simultaneous transactions
4. User notification for sync status and conflicts
